### Professional Portfolio Project

### Project Overview
This personal portfolio showcasing work samples, skills, and experience for potential employers. The portfolio is built using advanced CSS concepts, including flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables, to create a responsive and professional design.

This portfolio will serve as a central hub for sharing live deployed projects and professional information during job searches.

### User Story
As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can assess their suitability for an open position.

### Features
Developer Information: The portfolio displays the developer's name, recent photo/avatar, and sections about their background, skills, and work.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices using media queries and flexbox.

Navigation: A smooth scrolling navigation bar allows users to quickly jump to different sections of the portfolio.

Work Showcase: A section dedicated to deployed applications, featuring titled images of the developer's projects.
Project Links: Each project image is clickable and redirects to the live, deployed version of the application.

Highlighted Project: The most recent or significant project is displayed with a larger image than the others to draw attention.
Contact Information: A section is provided to easily get in touch with the developer via links or a contact form.

### Acceptance Criteria
The portfolio meets the following criteria to satisfy a typical hiring manager's needs:

Name and Photo: The homepage displays the developer's name and a recent photo or avatar.
Navigation Links: The navigation bar allows users to scroll to specific sections (About Me, Work, Contact).
Work Section: Displays titled images of the developer's applications. The first application image is larger than the others.
Project Links: Clicking on project images takes the user to the deployed live version of each application.
Responsive Layout: The portfolio adapts to different screen sizes and devices, maintaining a user-friendly experience.

### Technologies Used
